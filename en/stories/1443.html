I can！”给学生鼓劲。这也不难解释，为什么孩子们对他的离开如此不舍。爱人者，人恒爱之。我们都是感性的动物。哪怕你自诩理性而冷静，有谁能够敌过“爱”对心灵的温暖呢？我们能做的，是不拒绝别人对你的爱，也无私而勇敢的给予别人你的爱。作为一名英语教师，我却不是那么热衷于听英文歌，然唯独偏爱一首：《better man》。better可不可以看作为英文单词里最有中文禅意的词呢？ 我们不必是最好，却可以是更好的自己。better，因为它并非极致，所以仍有余地。你前进了一厘米，是better，你前进了一万米，也是better，都可以拍拍自己，对自己说，祝贺你，你已经是更好的你自己。回首这一年，是你们的爱，让我成为了更好的自己。\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":1645,"date":1476681565,"tags":["life upon

记得是在去南京的大巴上，慢热的我一上车就往最后一排跑，把自己窝在角落里，也没想过去认识新的人。在稍显安静的车内沉默许久后不禁抬头看向前排，看见一个笑得很开朗的女生。是那种发自内心的微笑，眼睛里闪着期待的光，对去南京的交流有种迫不及待的样子。她与旁边的朋友小声地交谈着什么，嘴角也止不住的上扬。突然就感觉自己内心也活跃了些，也对接下来的活动有更多的期待。    到了南京那边，看着体育馆里那么多人自由热情地交谈，心下那种陌生的感觉也少了些，拉起同行的女生就往里走。各个国家的人与特色聚集在一起有一种和谐的感觉。印象最深的是一个小座一个十八九岁姑娘在往孩子们脸上画她们想要的图案。我们走了过去，等了许久也不到我们。又来了一个女生，等了一会儿后却是自己用手抹了三种颜料就自行画了起来，还问我们要不要一起。欣然答应，在脸上留下了这次交流的印记。     而今年的7月24号下午，许多来宾在我们的港中参加了容领挑战活动的开幕式。有同学们分享他们生活中爱的故事，用最真诚质朴的语言去表达心中的爱。大提琴与小提琴拉出的音符似乎在报告厅上空合奏，混合着钢琴曲的优雅，还有我校魅力男生第一次合唱的默契。这些那些，都少不了开幕式前他们辛苦的排练。很遗憾没能参与活动前的准备，但是看着她们和他们每天很早的就赶去排练，说着夏日忙碌的炎热，说着排练好的满足，讨论那些细枝末节，也感到这个暑假的充实。    开幕式到尾声，剑桥大学副校长讲话的时候提到：我们每个人都不笨，只要去努力就可以。与我同去的妈妈听得很认真，听到这些的时候还拍拍我，示意我要听进去。我笑笑，转过头去看台上翻译没记下那么多话的小插曲，看着台下的人认真的样子，我想大家应该都会记住今天这个美丽的日子吧。    在参与了多次容领挑战活动之后，自己也充分意识到了这个团队名字中的“挑战”二字。这是需要我们有勇气去认识新的朋友新的世界，有勇气在陌生的地方大胆地表达心中真实的想法，也真正有勇气在一次次活动中甚至以后的生活中去挑战自己！    人生真的没有通向梦想的康庄大道，也没人知道你现在准备的每一件事，未来会有怎样的结果，但可以肯定是，你鼓起勇气走的每一条有准备的路，都会让你离你的梦更近一步。而现在的每一次摸索与摩擦，都会让你在未来有一点不同。    记得看过这样一句话：“当初看似到不了的未来，都成了你经历过的云淡风轻。”我想真正能做到这样，绝少不了一份勇气，而这也是我在这个团队中学到的最宝贵的东西。也有本书里说到：“如果你仔细倾听被遗忘的角落，会听到，每一株小草都有微小而洪亮的声音。如果你向着尘埃俯下身去，会看到，每一只蚂蚁都有坚强而卑微的微笑。”    而我想说，如果你有勇气向前迈出一步又一步，会发现，你的每一点付出都铺成了去往你梦想的路。\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":1643,"date":1476681519,"tags":["life upon

暑假即将到来的时候，我幻想着补课之余的所有娱乐时间，但是突然，接到了国际荣领这么一个从未接触过也未曾想参加的活动，我是打算不参加的，但是，我被组织老师的一句话打动了：港中只剩下你们这些希望了，把你们由松散的个体迅速组织成一个有序的团体，一个奇迹即将产生。也许是平日里挑战新事物的次数多了，竟就这么同意参加了。至少，我会为我的行为负责，既然答应了，那就只好做了。                                                                                                                          就这样，被分配到魅力男生的我还是成了一个不起眼的存在。我努力提高我的存在感，和外教谈话，参加后勤，临场指挥他人，只是我在雪地里走过的脚印，走过就被雪又覆盖了——备受关注的人太多了，有人既参加演讲又参加合唱还有后勤，舞台上下到处都是忙碌的人的身影，我被埋没了。没错，我五天来什么都没做成，却在无谓地期待，期待会被人看到，会被人记住，但是，很遗憾，我直到出了会场看到一个认识的人，他说，我是来看演出的吗...我“嗯”了一声，走了。                                      但是呢，我打了个电话给我妈，她告诉我他的座位并叫我等他，我只好坐下来听最后的演讲。so，我醒悟了。 我发现，我坐在台上和台下感觉完全不一样。在后台看到那么多人跑来跑去的，台上却什么也看不见，只有演讲人和他神奇的翻译，我融入了观众席上的氛围，发现周边的许多人都这样，我若有所思。                                                                     然后，翻译的一切我都看在了心里。虽然他可能只是紧张，但是，他努力着，即便脸红也要翻译，即便错误也要翻译，添油加醋的太多，只是为了让观众理解并且尽可能委婉，他称不上是最努力的那一个，但他是努力中的一个，所以，我记住他了。他是我继卢博士和外教记得最清楚的，甚至比剑桥的副校还要清楚，因为我一直在看着他，看他努力，看他坚持，哪怕这并不是会为人民所记住的，但是，他努力过。                                                                                                                       嗯，我也努力了，会不会被像我这样关注努力的人记住，这是次要的，但是我发现，只要努力了，每个人都能熠熠闪光。            所以，我重新体会了一下“奇迹”的意义，发现奇迹真的发生了，因为这一次开幕式，很成功。\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":1637,"date":1476681240,"tags":["life upon

am thankful！当我真正站在台上说出那一句“I can do

在整个活动中，所有学生、老师、组织者们的善良和爱心给我留下了深刻的印象。他们热情地欢迎我们，冒着酷暑在活动间隙陪我们去登山和参观当地著名的景点。更让我震撼和感动的是当地学生的心声，他们讲述着在公共汽车上将座位让给一位老太太、自己遇到困难受到热心人的帮助等一个个动人的小故事。而这所有的故事无不激励着人们向他人去传递爱。 开幕式结束后，我常常不禁回想起过去一周中的所见所闻、所思所想，我和那里的学生和老师建立了深厚的友谊，那么多优秀的老师和学生讲诉的动人故事始终温暖着我，让我想起了我曾就读中学的另一个充满爱的团体。当我刚进入中学时，我与几位同学成了好朋友。不久我发现其中一位同学的困难，他父亲生了重病，需要一大笔钱治疗。我和几位同学在老师的指导下建立了一个班级基金，同学们用自己的零用钱捐款。虽然这些捐款可能是微不足道的，但代表着同学们的一片爱心，就这样这个以帮助需要帮助的同学的班级爱心基金建立起来了。我开了一个银行账户，定期去把大家的捐款存在银行里。钱很零散，但我们认真清点，一丝不苟地记账，银行工作人员得知我们的用意，也都十分热情地接待办理。在那个学期，看着银行帐户里的钱一天天增长就是我最大的快乐。虽然在那年中期，那位同学必须离开我们这个城市，回到他的家乡。我们还是设法将钱送给了他，给了他力所能及的帮助。当达成了这个目标后，我们还让基金继续地运行着。特别是在2013年四川省雅安遭受地震时，我们还用基金向地震灾区捐了款。我和同学一直认真、尽责地维护着这个充满爱心的小基金，直到我们初中毕业。 尽管这个小小的爱心基金现在早已不存在了，但这段经历如爱和希望的种子已深深的植根于我的脑海。在我的人生旅程中我会带着国际容领新生代人才培养计划的目标——“生命影响生命，活出无私大爱”，竭尽全力给人们带去温暖，将爱传递！\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":1631,"date":1476680587,"tags":["life upon

On the day I was born , my grandpa fainted when informed of that I was a girl. And since that day , my memory was filled with the scenes where they fought and quarreled.

When I was at primary school , the homework seemed to doubled, I don’t  remember it well. But I do remember the time when my Chinese teacher threw the exercise books one by one upon my face , which forced me to stepped backwards , from the front desk to the last one.

My nephew is a senior this year in a middle school which is located in the town and has good graduation rates, but he was dropped home 10 days after beginning class. Sister stated to me all what happened on the phone, almost with tears–the teacher head said her child was later for class due to head-washing in the morning( in fact he washed last night). School has a rule- prohibite playing basketball at noon but he ignored. He played alone in the playground and kept on playing even if the teacher came near to him. Actually I well know my nephew-I see him growing up slowly and know he is as kind and honest as children from the village, but he is also rebellious at his age. He has ever fought for the intimate male friends and it should be ok for him to keep exam scores top five in the class. Even though forced to leave school, he does everything without any regret. On summer vacation he promises me to pursue famous 211 university but played the game once get home. Furthermore, he is so indifferent to his own parents that his mother smashed computer furiously and then he slammed the door. The family atmosphere turns in a mess. I well understand all his mother’s pains and sense of helplessness. However, after repentance, I find that I am prejudged at that issue and gradually deeply understand him. Washing head is only show he takes much attention on appearance but without disciplined mistakes. Washing again in the next morning perhaps because hairstyle is not charming enough after one night. Playing basketball at noon may because he is not satisfactory to headteacher’s misunderstanding and criticism. And keeping on playing is possibly a kind of slient protest. This time, so fierce protest is a collective performance. Obviously the teacher doesn’t solve the problem by dropping him home, and neither are my sister& brother-in-law.At the thought of this , I can not help bursting a cold sweat because I made such mistake as the headteacher-dropping students home and saying to students’ parents “do not come back class without any repentance” . As a matter of fact, I overlooked one fact that the parents may not solve the problem and perhaps the whole family loses in great pains. After meditation, I suggest Sister to understand her son because the studying assignment is so hard and high pressured for a senior and perhaps he will be punished by a teacher when mistakes are made. It is not likely that rebellious children under huge pressure will be mature to deal with problems. It is also easy for us to understand he is repressed under multiple pressures when sitting in the classroom and meanwhile he can not express his meaning when faced with closest parents. Gradually he fails to find a harbor to protect his soul. In sum, the best solution is help him to find out the reasons behind it and then overcome. I know my nephew is not good at English and Biology, then I share my ways to learning, encourage him to ask the teacher more, and persuade his mother to look for a teacher to make up a missed lesson, help him to alleviate the pressure of learning”,.

My nephew is a senior this year in a middle school which is located in the town and has good graduation rates, but he was dropped home 10 days after beginning class. Sister stated to me all what happened on the phone, almost with tears–the teacher head said her child was later for class due to head-washing in the morning (in fact he washed last night). School has a rule prohibiting playing basketball at noon but he ignored. He played alone in the playground and kept on playing even if the teacher came near to him. Actually I well know my nephew--I see him growing up slowly and know he is as kind and honest as children from the village, but he is also rebellious at his age. He has ever fought for the intimate male friends and it should be ok for him to keep exam scores top five in the class.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though forced to leave school, he does everything without any regret.

Furthermore, he is so indifferent to his own parents that his mother smashed computer furiously and then he slammed the door. The family atmosphere turns in a mess. I well understand all his mother’s pains and sense of helplessness. However, after repentance, I find that I am prejudged at that issue and gradually deeply understand him. Washing head only shows he takes much attention on appearance but without disciplined mistakes. Washing again in the next morning perhaps because hairstyle is not charming enough after one night. Playing basketball at noon may because he is not satisfactory to headteacher’s misunderstanding and criticism. And keeping on playing is possibly a kind of silent protest. This time, so fierce protest is a collective performance. Obviously the teacher doesn’t solve the problem by dropping him home, and neither are my sister and brother-in-law.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the thought of this, I can not help bursting a cold sweat because I made such mistake as the headteacher, dropping students home and saying to students’ parents “Do not come back class without any repentance.” As a matter of fact, I overlooked one fact that the parents may not solve the problem and perhaps the whole family loses in great pains. After meditation, I suggest Sister to understand her son because the studying assignment is so hard and high pressured for a senior and perhaps he will be punished by a teacher when mistakes are made. It is not likely that rebellious children under huge pressure will be mature to deal with problems. It is also easy for us to understand he is repressed under multiple pressures when sitting in the classroom and meanwhile he can not express his meaning when faced with closest parents. Gradually he fails to find a harbor to protect his soul.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sum, the best solution is help him to find out the reasons behind it and then overcome. I know my nephew is not good at English and Biology, then I share my ways to learning, encourage him to ask the teacher more, and persuade his mother to look for a teacher to make up a missed lesson, help him to alleviate the pressure of learning.

I thought it was a program of great importance. There were six international friends who were either foreigners or overseas Chinese. They came from different parts of the world and were all very successful in their own fields. Each took part and made a speech in turn. Some of these speeches were full of excitement and passion, and some were deeply moving. In all, as the old saying goes, 'I learn more from listening to what you have to say during one conversation than from reading books for ten years’. Here are my thoughts and my understanding of these speeches.Firstly, my thoughts on making choices. Making choices was the topic of the overseas Chinese lady’s speech. She inspired us by telling us her life story. As she said, “Life is as short as that of a mayfly.” During our short life, everyone must make lots of decisions regardless of the consequences. But please do persevere because no one can make the right decision every time, so be brave and move on.Secondly, my thoughts on misfortune. Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise. This topic is the summary of what I have learned from director Da Dao Liu. No sooner had he started his speech than I thought he was just like the legendary frontiersman Sai Weng who lost his horse. What he wanted to tell us is that life is full of chances and miracles. Stick to your dreams and keep trying. Do not complain about minor setbacks which may surpise you with hidden blessings.Thirdly, my thoughts on love. Love can be inclusive of everything. It is the source of power. There are five circles of love: education, friends, work, family and health. In her opinion, these five circles are equally important. They can be put together and made into one thing: love. Everything comes from love. After I thought about it over and over again, I came to the conclusion that she was right. We have been struggling and fighting for different kinds of love.

We talked with foreign friends when we visited. What surprises me was that foreign friends were so enthusiasticSo we not only talked about the aim of the event, but also about the folk customs and national history of the evolution of their country. Secondly, the activity has a large stage, drum song filled with the audience, the audience applauded without stop, lively and extraordinary.During this visit, we couldn't help but marvel at the school of functional diversification, \"It can accept students from all different countries\".

When we heard the news , we all felt excited !On Saturday, when I saw the building with “Nanjing International school”, I realized it’s true!” “I will see the friends again!” I thought. Sue who has been to our school waited for us at the school gate. We were happy to see each other. She took us to the room where the activity started.The large room was divided into many places. There were many small stores in it. But they didn’t sell things. They introduced the traditional and special food to us. We can eat them free, such as grape wine from Italy, roast bread from France, macarons from Malaysia and so on. Every store was decorated by their countries’ symbol. So we seemed to visit different countries truly.Suddenly, I saw a man who was seeing me “oh !” I smiled happily. It is KEN that came to our school last time, I had talked with him happily .We shook hands. He talked with us and introduced us to see the big show which was organized by their school’s students .After that, we asked the questions about their school .he told us patiently.Finally, we should go home .We invited them to our school again.

After dinner, we sat in the cars, and went to Nanjing national school.An hour later, we arrived at our destination. To my surprise, the architectural style here is not the European style, but the Chinese style, which makes it beautiful. Then we went to the hall, the various countries wore different kinds of clothes. The place looked colorful and immediately caught our eyes.In this \"small world\" I enjoyed a lot. I saw Germany and its passion for football, saw Holland and its orange charm. I felt that I was in the world cup, making me excited. You know, I'm crazy about football! I talked with a Germany about the world cup and the football clubs . Then, I met some old friends who we had treated last time , we also talked for a while, so that we could know more about their study and living.In this mini Expo, Sweden, Canada, Korea, The UK…every different country made me have a good time .Of course, the food here was also delicious, they are truly different from what we eat in school. But what impressed me most was the two kinds of food which I dare not to try again. The cheese in Netherlands , when I put it into my mouth ,I felt a strong smell and it tasted salty .I almost immediately spit it down. Another was the apple of Mexico, it was spicy and sour.Finally, we left the school, I was  tired but happy too. I hope I can have this kind of opportunity to experience more things and enjoy the charm of the world culture.&nbsp;仲力行Zhong LixingChristopherMarch 10th ,2015\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":1452,"date":1465994376,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"早春访“南国”","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E深秋的那一天，我印象深刻；早春的这一天，同样令我难以忘怀。自从上次南京国际学校的客人们来访过后，便听说了会有回访的机会，只是未曾想过，这样的机会会来得这样突然，霎那间为新的学期添上了浓墨重彩的一笔。等待的时间那样漫长，还好没有长到失去等待的意义。盼了一个星期，终于踏上了这场奇异的旅程。天气虽不晴朗，却在平静中透出丝丝的不寻常，心情无疑是兴奋的，再瞧瞧同去的同学们，也都是一般笑靥如花。终于到了南京国际学校，校门外车水马龙热闹喧哗，校门内则是另一番景象。虽也是人流如织，但青青的草色配上淡黄色古色古香的建筑，多了几丝静谧，而来往人们的外国面庞，无异是与景色的一大碰撞，却也别有韵味。上次见过面的Sue在门口热情地迎接我们，顿时多了几分亲切。她带领我们进了活动的场馆，这是本次回访的重头戏。场馆内人很多，气氛火热。一间一间的小隔间环布馆内四周，代表了一个又一个的国家。每个“国家”的装饰都极具民族特色，各自门前又摆满了代表自己国家的食物、标志性纪念品，每个“国家”的主人们都身穿各自传统的服饰在热情地接待来往的客人，介绍他们的习俗、食品和独特的游戏。我们被琳琅满目的“国家”吸引，迫不及待地要开始“环游世界”。穿梭在各个“国家”之间，各国语言在耳边变幻，糅合成动听的旋律；品尝着各国的美食，各种各样的食物看得我眼花缭乱，无从取舍；欣赏体验着各国的文化，来自各国的学生、老师、甚至家长都热情地展示着各自国家的风情。随着“国家”印章一个个集满，记忆也一个个被定格：充满异域气氛的场馆，带着迷人微笑的金发碧眼的外国朋友们，激情洋溢的韩国击鼓表演……当然，最令我兴奋的还是遇到了老朋友Ken，我们与Ken交流了很多关于学校的看法，他们学校轻松自主的学习和生活方式实在令我羡慕不已。离开Party的热闹氛围，我们又参观了校园。这样的学校，虽然不是很大，却将一草一木甚至每一寸土地都发挥得恰到好处，这是一座精致的校园。干净、整洁是我最深刻的印象。学校已经成立多年，可任何东西看起来都像是新的一样，这让斑斓的校园展现出迷人的光芒。如何让一所偌大的校园处处保持整洁美观，这的确是需要我们反思并学习的。我想，爱护的心理，文明的行为，良好的习惯，只要我们做到这些，也必将能为我们自己创设出一样美丽的学习和生活环境！一天的回访在不知不觉中结束了，流连之余，更是感恩，有幸得到了大多数学生都不会有的宝贵经历，就必当珍惜、珍藏、学习、进取！Since I heard about the chance to visit Nanjing International School, I have expected the day to come for a long time. I believed that it would be a special part of the new term.The day when we went there finally came . Though the weather is not fine enough, I saw smile on everyone’s face , and maybe it could match , the sun . In a word, we were all excited and were looking forward to the amazing trip.When I arrived at Nanjing International school ,I found that green grass and light-yellow wall made the school quiet , which is different from the noisy atmosphere outside the school .sue, who we met last time ,took us to the place where the National Day party held. I saw different booths named after different countries.I almost couldn’t wait to begin to travel around the world.Playing among different  ‘countries’ ,listening to different languages, I felt amazed. Tasting traditional food, I regretted having eaten so much at lunch that I couldn’t eat as much as I wanted. Enjoying different cultures, I was moved by the enthusiastic students , teachers and parents from all over the world. Many unforgettable and unbelievable experience were kept in my mind. It was when I met my  ‘Old friend ’ ken that made me feel most excited .We talked about the school life, both in my school and in his school . The freedom and relief in this school attracted us and we all wanted to be as happy as their students.We were shown around the school after the party. I was surprised by their tidy environment. Maybe this is one thing that makes the school attractive.

We were active to think a lot, then our thinking flied far away where we didn't touch when there was no limit, even we didn't prepare well.It was easy for us to resolve maths questions, and we tried our best to build a bridge. Water wave contained our heartbeat when one by one coin was put into water on the bridge. Fail but no regret. Strive but no regret. The second time, we leared from last time and we leaded in the first part of the activity. We were happy, but not only because of extreme ease of victory but the process. The only defect was the structure of the bridge. I have to say the other team's bridge was better than ours, but finally we got No.1. I felt a little sorry. In fact, winning doesn't matter.

Behind us appeared a string of footprints,  the sun shone our smiling faces, and the smiles became more splendid. The string of footprints recorded my joy and growth. Childhood is happy and carefree. I hope I could be a child forever. When in the kindergarten, I liked reading most. I always pestered my mother to take me to the bookstore for reading book every dusk. Through the bustling pedestrian street, we came to the door of the bookstore. Childhood, I always loved to tread the several big footprints step to step outside the door, which was so funny. Now although I don't have the kind of happiness of childhood, but I  have a more substantial happiness, that is reading books. Books take me to swim in the sea of  knowledge and the big footprints outside the bookstore are the proof of my joyful growth. Now I am a high school first grade student  and almost out of breath for every pressure accompanied with one after another failure. Today I screwed up the exam again. I held the piece of math test which was less than eighty points, with tears spinning in my eyes. I was sick and tired. I listlessly walked on the way home, inadvertently set foot in the bunker again in which I played in childhood, leaving a string of footprints. A gust of wind blew, so that piece of paper in my hand was blown away to the bunker, and I hurriedly to picked it up. Suddenly, I saw the footprints, which reminded me of my happy footprints left here when I ran in my childhood. They also reminded me of treading on the big footprints in front of the bookstore when in kindergarten. Thought of here, I smiled from the heart. Ah, I understand that in fact happiness has accompanied me by my side, along with my growth. Is the failures and setbacks a kind of hint of happiness? How can you I rainbow without experiencing a rainy and windy day? Only withstood test can I get happiness, the most substantial happiness. Only smile can make me feel the exist of happiness. Right, I firmly nodded. I must work hard. I want to get the good grades! I picked up the paper, stepped on my way home. Behind me left a string of footprints, which turned gold for the sunshine. They are the footprints to success and happiness. Thanks to the footprints, making me find the confidence and happiness in my childhood. Indeed, as long as I observe carefully, I will find it.

In the spring afternoon, one or two twitter constituted musical notes in the spring. I was a child then, liked to ride a bike to wander in the plot in a quite afternoon. I was alone with breeze.

Naughty me had an idea to ride my crooked bike upon the slope. I closed eyes, it was quiet except the breeze.

The next day, when the rescuers followed the crying to dig soil, they opened the roof and find a naked girl curled up under the roof. Unexpectedly she was alive. The rescuers hurried to embrace the girl. But she didn’t want to leave anyway. Pointing with her little hand she cried out: “ Mum……” Along a pair of muddy hands faintly showed the rescuers gingerly dug down. Then they saw a dramatic picture: A half naked woman, was in a standing position, hands held high above her head, was like a sculpture of a lifter. The woman was unexpectedly blind, whose body had already stiff. Under her body, a man was also dug standing firm with raised head. It was that the woman held the little girl high standing on the man’s shoulders  how the little girl magically became the only survivor of the catastrophic mudslides. For animals as well as humans, only parents’ love is silent and unconditional. At the moment of crisis, they always give up themselves without turning back to leave the hope of life to their offspring. The blind parents’ magnificent behavior of giving themselves to save their child is the perfect interpretation of maternal love power. Love is like mountain, which is great, lofty and heavy.

The little child was holding the old man tightly, with the small head closed to  his back. I gave special attention to both of them, so I immediately ran to the last position in the team of our class to take a look at where they wanted to go. Oh, they went to eat in the mess hall. Look! The old man was walking up the stairs step by step with the little child on the back. I was staring at them. I kept watching and immediately realized that they were father and son. I had such judgment because I thought only for his own child would he take good care of him in this way. Sitting in the mess hall, my eyes were still condensed on the father and son. Look! The old man put his son gently on the bench, waiting the child to finish the meal.

There was a mother who had kept on doing one thing every single day after being announced of her son’s brain death, which was talking to him and telling him funny stories continuously, though her son would probably never know. And the first thing to do every morning she woke up was to make porridge for her son, perhaps it was not much to be particular about, but it truly is as to a never waken-up son, since each single plump grain of rice was carefully picked out by his mother. After being cleaned, the rice was put into a crock with some purified water, and then boiled with soft fire. When the porridge was done, the mother would slowly pour it into a bowl, blowing a lot to cool the porridge, while shaking her head slightly from side to side. She kept blowing till having no strength to breathe, then she took out a spoon, trying feeding her son, smiling a lot. But the son’s eyes wouldn’t open, as if refusing all of this emotionlessly.

A reporter was sent to cover the accident. And when the camera captured a young man who had broken both legs, with blood spilling out and dirt all over his body, he actually stood up, wiping the mud on his face and then looked at the camera with a big bright smile, which stunned the reporter a lot. But when the reporter began to aim the camera at his broken legs, the young man tried to hide them and said to the reporter: “just capture my face, please.” But soon he fell down for standing on a single leg. The reporter ran over to him and asked why he did so. The young man replied: “I live in rural area and I’ve just come out from home for a short time, I don’t want my mother to worry about me.” So the reporter lent him a cellphone to connect his family, however, the young man told that there was no phone at his home and the only way to inform his mother of his safety was the TV news. All what he wished was to let his mother see him living well and his big warm smile rather than his broken legs. Later on, the accident was broadcast on television, only the young man smiled like a blossoming flower among others’ endless tears.Sometimes love can indeed be plain and great at the same time.

And now, I am starting out a new journey of my life, which is destined and I will not escape. No matter what it is, I will accept it and try to conquer it, because my mission is to create new hopes.” —Park Geun-hyeI am greatly touched by the autobiography of Park Geun-hye. One thing that differs the president from us is her unique qualities.Having gone through the assassination of her parents, her life was changing a lot since then. The people who had been in favor of her father Park Chung-hee betrayed him and began to denounce him. As a consequence, she and her siblings left the Blue House in grief. She had once attempted to give up on politics, but the encouragement from civilians added to her confidence. It was in 1977, Korea was facing its economic depression, and Park Geun-hye joined Grand National Party. With principle and belief in heart, she led the party into a journey to solve left-over problems and to strive for congressional seats. In order to canvass for the party, she would walk a long way to remote areas every day to shout slogans to people working in the fields. And she was even once being assassinated during canvass, the wound on her neck was 11 centimeters long, nearly 5 millimeters away from carotid artery. Fortunately she survived.Only in despair can we find hope, which is perfectly explained by Park Guen-hye. Compared to what she had been through, the setbacks we are confronted with in life seem to be nothing. But honestly, we should be as positive and optimistic as she always is.

The dog had been living with him for a decade or more since it was a puppy. They had traveled more than half of Japan together over the years, and the dog had saved the old man in danger twice. However, it became serious ill and was beyond recovery now. The dog lay in bed, kept staring at his owner. And the old man felt it seemed to have something to say, whereupon he sent for a dog translator to help.The translator came forward and put on special headphones for both him and the dog. And soon, he began to weep a lot.The dog said: “ my old friend, I know I am dying now.

The mother almost died in the surrounding where was no water, no light, no other things and couldn’t move. But she couldn’t. Her blood would stop flowing if she died. One week later, the rescue workers found them according to the baby’s crying and shocked: the mother closed her eyes after her baby was rescued, her face was pale and every finger was pierced. There was a heavy rain when the doctor raised the baby, people said the heaven was moved by the mother. People didn’t understand why she can live for seven days no food, no water and blood flowed up. It’s because of the love of mother. She made a miracle, and she sang a song of great love. She treated her baby’s live more important than hers, that’s why she can feed her baby using her blood. This remind me the reason that we sing the praises of mother’s love is to love and filial to parents. Our parents are with us during our whole life until they die.

Looking back on the experience of 12-years in education, I do not create an impressing and worthy achievement but my teaching career has given me valuable experience in classroom teaching. Being involved in mathematics teaching has been a great pleasure to me. I enjoy watching my students smile with great joy under my education. In 2012, I took over senior ART school mathematics teaching. At that time, quite a lot of students in this class had poor maths skills. They had a weak understanding of basic mathematics and moreover disliked the subject, they also did not listen carefully in class-sometimes fidgeting or sleepy, which had a direct impact on the quality of my teaching. At first, I was confident with instilling  my way of teaching, dedicated work style, and funny discussion incentives and believed that these could change their learning attitude and improve their maths scores. However, a month passed and there were no signs  of positive change. It was at this point that the words from the lesson representative in the class greatly touched me.One day when I had just finished the class and was walking out of the classroom, a student followed me, lowering their head they said to me: \"teacher, please can you not ask me questions when in class?\" I ask \"why?\" She whispered: \"because I was scared of the look in your eyes. Whenever I answer the wrong topic, although you don't say anything, the look in your eyes and serious facial expressions are criticizing me.\" These words shocked me a lot. I always thought that as long as I praise the students more verbally , encourage them more in written form, their self-confidence will improve and their learning enthusiasm will be aroused, but this remark proved that I was wrong. This situation made me realise that yes, a smile is the most beautiful and friendly form of communication. Now let me use the smile to arouse the students’ quiet hearts. Hence, in the subsequent teaching, I came into the classroom every day with a great smile on my face, communicated with students with kind eye contact, and slowly the students become more interested in me, smiling, especially ones with the original bad grades. They are brave enough to join in, had the courage and the power of learning and became active in the classroom. After only one semester, the math grades of the whole class greatly improved. Perhaps, it was that my eyes flow with encouragement and affirmation, like spurts of warm current, to warmed their low-esteem and depressed hearts. From my eyes they became confident and had the power to walk forward, step by step.Today, they are no longer the previous \"bi ma wen\". Once some students said to me \"I like mathematics most because I can get fairness in your classroom. I hate the teachers who are partial towards good students. Due to that dislike, I am very tired of those types of lessons. But your impartial and selfless heart seems like a clear sky-clear, clean, transparent. Your eyes can convey the power of justice and brighten my heart. Your strict eye expression shows affection –gentleness come from silence. Your eyes are like the gurgled river to constantly cleanse people’s soul.” In my opinion, as long as we have a full immersion in the soul of human love, we pass on to the students the most beautiful eyes. Only such people will grow on the tendrils of human nature, burst out the fragrance of love. Keep in mind—be sure to enter the classroom with a sincere smile! We should encourage students to make any attempt on learn. Yet we should also remember to tell  the students that \"error is inevitable and that they should not shy away from the possibility of making mistakes. I like your mistakes.\" From then on, I began smiling often , patiently listening to the students, preventing the other students’ mocking others and protecting the students' self-esteem and their enthusiasm for learning mathematics. In the usual teaching activity, I often praise and encourage students because I realize more and more that hope to get the affirmation of the others is the nature of each person(especially a child). A positive evaluation is a strong driving force to inspire students, build their confidence and become more positive to all kinds of things. Now, from the students’ eagerness to learn maths,  the active answering in class and active resolving problems after class, I have a satisfactory answer.ZHANG ZICHAO\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":270,"date":1449022718,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"感动 Get Moved","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E记得高二上学期快要放寒假了，将近半个多月没有看到太阳的影子了，天气一直阴冷，时常还下点雨夹雪，还要再上五天的课才能放假，教室里时不时传来咳嗽声，还有的无精打采地趴在桌上，看来很多同学都是带病上课了。每次走进教室，听到同学们的咳嗽声，我总忘不了提醒学生要注意防寒，防感冒。其实这几天我也有点发烧。就在放假前的最后一天，我高烧到39.5℃，，那天上午还有三节课，真是难受的要命。终于快要放学了，我提前结束了新课，留了几分钟让学生自习。中午放学后，我没吃午饭直接来到校医务室，这时的我已是冷得全身发抖了，在打点滴时我一边烤火，一边打盹。这时突然传来一个熟悉的声音，有人在冲着我叫老师好。他就是我的学生——徐某，他是来还医务室的医疗费的，昨天打完针，今天已基本痊愈了，看到我刚才还在上课，怎么下课后就来打点滴了。于是和我聊起来，说要陪我一阵子。从谈话中我知道他已打过三天的点滴才好的，我说我昨天下午也来打过一针，没有效果。他说他昨天下午也在这打针，怎么没看到我呢？我说是下午三点后，他说是三点前就结束了。就这么巧错过了。聊了一会儿我让他不用陪我，还是早点回去吧，他最后还是听了我的话，离开了医务室。大约中午一点钟，他又来到医务室来看我，手里还端着一碗热气腾腾的馄炖。看到这场景，医务室的医生和病友们都被这个学生的举动给打动了，还说从没见过有这么好的学生，能主动买一碗馄炖给老师吃，真是难得。这时我也真得被我的学生感动了。假如是他生病了，我买一碗馄炖给他吃，我觉得这很正常。但眼前这一幕，让我真是深记在心。吃了这碗热馄炖后，我浑身出汗，顿时感觉病好多了，这时医生也说感冒出了汗就会好。真得要谢谢这碗热馄炖，谢谢这位同学。从这件事情我发现，老师平时在教室的一言一行，还是会被学生记在心里。老师的付出，学生也记在心里。只要我们老师真心对学生，学生也会真心对老师，学生就会从心里尊重老师，爱戴老师。魏俊Remember when winter vacation was coming soon in the sophomore year of high school, we didn’t see the sun for almost more than half a month. The weather was always cloudy and cold, sometimes snowy and rainy. We would not start our holiday until finishing all lessons in the last 5 days. At that moment coughs came out from time to time in the classroom, and some students were listlessly prone on the table. It was likely that many students were in class and were ill. Every time I walked into the classroom, students’ coughs always made me remind students to keep warm, as a precaution to fever. Actually, on those days even I got a slight fever. On the last day before the holiday, my fever reached 39.5 ℃ and felt so bad but I had three pending lessons in the morning. Finally when the class was nearly over, I finished the lesson in advance and kept a few balanced minutes to let the students self-study. At noon after school, I went directly to the school clinic without lunch. At that time, I was trembling with cold and set up a fire to keep myself warm. Suddenly there came a familiar voice, greeting me. The person was my student, Mr. Xu, who was recovering that day after having injections the day before and came to the clinic to pay his medical bill.Confused by the reason why I was In the clinic for injection now but was in the class a moment ago, he chatted with me and kept me company for a while. From our conversation, I knew that he felt better after 3-days on an intravenous drip. I told him that I had one injection yesterday afternoon but there was no positive effect. He said he also had this injection yesterday afternoon but wondered why he didn't see me. I said mine was at three o 'clock in the afternoon and he said he was over before three o 'clock. After a while chatting, I asked him to go home early and he finally followed my advice to leave the clinic.  At about one pm, Mr. Xu came to the infirmary to look after me again with a bowl of steaming dumplings. The clinic doctors and patients were struck by his behavior and said that they had never seen a student as good as him , buying a bowl of dumplings for his teacher. It was really rare. At that moment I was really moved by Xu. –my student. If he was ill, I would bring a bowl of dumplings for him to eat and I would think this is normal. But the scene in the front impressed me so deep in the heart. After eating a bowl of hot dumplings, I immediately started sweating and felt much better. The doctor also said to me that sweating was good after a cold. Thank you for the bowl of hot dumplings, thanks student. I found from this thing that the teacher's behaviors in the classroom at ordinary times will be kept in students’ minds. The teacher's pains will also live in the students’ mind. As long as our teachers treat the students well and sincerely, students will be sincere to the teacher and respect the teachers from the heart, love them.WEI JUN\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":266,"date":1449020738,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"一个陌生人的电话 A stranger on the phone","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E岁月无痕，当我们蓦然回首，翻阅着自己的心灵，总有一段段记忆在生命中留下深深的痕迹，无法忘却，每当我们拾起它时，心里总涌动着一丝久违的冲动，这便是感动。生活里有许多感动，如果你有一双善于发现美的眼睛，你会发现春天小草勃发是一种感动，朋友关怀的眼神是一种感动，父母无私的关爱是一种感动，陌生人的一个电话也是一种感动......生活处处使我感动。暑假期间，我和先生带着儿子去青岛游玩，为了让孩子更多的了解海洋生物，我们去了极地海洋公园，因为是周末，人很多，所以步行过程中我们与先生走散。不巧的是，我的手机没电了，没法联系到先生。当时我第一时间想到的是广播寻人，但是人太多，孩子还小，广播室又离得太远，找广播室确实有点困难，于是我便旁向一卖东西的小姑娘寻问就近是否有公共电话，那小姑娘说这附近好象没有。由于儿子在这里玩兴正浓，加上也并没有急事，也许先生会回过头来找我们，我们就没有马上出去找公用电话，而是继续在那一带玩。过了一会儿，刚才那位女孩又找到我说：“你们是不是找不到电话？要不就用我的电话打一下吧。”我当然很高兴，说“太好了，我给你钱的。”那姑娘说，不要钱的，要钱我就不来找你了！ 用她的电话，我和先生联系上了。在广场休息时，吹着习习的凉风，我告诉了先生上述情况。我们都很感动，倒不是打一个电话能省多少钱的事，而是她并不是在别人央求下，而且是在别人已经走开一阵子的情况下又主动去找到别人来无偿让人打这个电话。虽然是微不足道的小事情，但这年头，这种行为却也不多见了。说实话，有时我自己就做不到这样。大约一个月前的一个周日，我们一家3口出去玩，在电影院附近遇到一个提大包裹的小姑娘问路，我们也不知道她要去的小区，看她一脸焦急的样子也只是在心里有一点儿同情罢了。直到过了半个多小时，我们徜徉在公园的优美风光里时，我还在说，也不知道那个女孩找到她要去的地方没有。我那一刻内疚地说，要是让她用我们的手机打一下电话不就得了。先生说，是啊。他就去找那个女孩，但已经不见了。与今天这个女孩相比，我们是多么地惭愧啊！我们当时为什么不能说：来，用我的电话问一下你要去的地方！我一个受过高等教育的自以为道德情操高尚的教师，常常高唱让世界充满爱，每每感叹世风日下，却与这个小姑娘有着多么大的差距啊！这是一件小到不能再小的小事，却给了很大很大的教育，一下子触动我们的心灵。为什么我们现在高唱和谐社会的人很多，但真正践行助人为乐的却越来越少？一方面是人心不古，没钱的事少有人做。一方面是骗局太多，人们不敢轻易帮助人，因帮助人被讹诈的事情经常发生。以至于你就是真心想帮助别人，有时被帮助者也会怀疑你的动机。你在大街上看到一个人提两三个重包，如果你要帮他（她）提，往往会遭拒绝，有的会礼貌地说谢谢，不用帮，有的也许会对你横眉冷对，有的甚至会以一副一眼看穿你不良动机的表情让你顿感尴尬。当我们面对别人的求助，为什么我们会在第一时间考虑是不是骗局？为什么我们认为可能这次不是骗局而后，我们仍然可以用害怕受骗的堂皇理由扬长而去？我们这是怎么了？是我们的社会病了，还是我们自己病入膏肓了？让我们大声呼喊，携手捍卫“助人为乐是一种美德，要从日常小事做起，不因善小而不为，应当在朋友正是困难的时候给予帮助，不可在事情已经无望之后再说闲话”的真理吧！张蓓Time flies without any trace!! When we suddenly look back on our days and flip through our mind, there is always a series of memories that will leave a deep mark in our life—unforgettable. Whenever we pick up it, a strange impulse will come out of our heart, it is to be TOUCHED. There are many TOUCHED in our ordinary lives, if you have a pair of good eyes to find beauty, you will find grass breaking out in the Spring as a kind of touched moment, the kind eyes from friends is a kind of touched moment, parents' selfless love is a kind of touched moment, a stranger’s phone is a kind of touched moment...Life often moves me. During the summer vacation when my husband and I brought our son to visit Qingdao, we went to the polar Ocean Park in order to make him learn more about the sea creatures. Because it was the weekend and there were too many people, we were separated by crowds when walking. Unfortunately, my mobile phone was power off at that moment and failed to keep in touch with my husband. I first thought to look for him by broadcasting but it was really difficult to look for a studio because there were too many people, our child was young and it was too far away from the broadcasting room. Then I asked a little girl who was selling items near me whether there is a public telephone in the area and she answered NO. We kept playing in that area instead of setting out to look for public telephone booth because of three reaons--my son was interested in playing, I did not have urgency maybe my husband will come back to find us. After a while, young girl came near and said to me: \" Can't you find the phone? Pls use my phone to call your relative.\" I was definitely very happy and said \"so great thank you, at least let me give you money.\"&nbsp;The girl said, “I don't need money.” With her telephone, I contacted with my husband. During the break in the square when enjoying cool wind, I told my husband the situation. Both of us were moved. It was not because the free phone call saved us money, but because she was so positive to find people who needed help and offer her phone to use without any request. Although it was a trivial thing, this kind of behaviour is rare. To be honest, sometimes I wouldn't be able to do something like that. One Sunday about a month ago, our family of three went out to play and encountered a little girl carrying a large package near the movie theatre, asking us the way, we didn't know the place she wanted to go and just appeared a little sympathy in our mind when looking at her anxious face. Until more than half an hour later when we were walking in the park and enjoyed beautiful scenery, I still said to my husband \"we still don't know whether that girl has found the place she needed to get to”. At the moment I felt guilty, and I said \"if I offered for her to use our mobile phone to call, it will be better”. He agreed ”Yes “and then we looked for that little girl but failed. Compared with the girl today, how ashamed we are! Why can't we say \"here, use my phone to find out where you are going!”I, who received high level education and have high moral ethics and often exclaim to make the world full of love, have a big gap compared to the girl who helped us in the polar park. This is a most trivial thing but teaches us such an important lesson that touches our hearts. So many people preach about helping someone else, to build a harmonious society, but few put it into practice. On the one hand there is much depravity, few people will do without money. Some because there are so many lies that people dare not to help others. People are often blackmailed after offering help. This symptom is so serious that your motivation will be doubted even if you want to help someone else sincerely. You tend to refuse to help when you see a man in the street with two or three heavy bags who is struggling, some will politely say thank you and not need help. Some may be looking at you without any expression, some will seem like you have bad motives which will cause you to feel embarrassed. When we are faced with others' help, why do we consider whether it is a scam in the first instance? Why do we created an excuse and feel  scared even if we think it’s not a scam. What has happened to us? Is our society sick? Let's shout loudly, and defend hand in hand \"helping others is a virtue. Let us start from the daily affairs –DO NOT DENY HELP BECAUSE OF THE TRIVIALS! Let’s also help friends when in dilemma”Zhang Bei\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":264,"date":1449020596,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"学会自己走路 Learn to Walk Your Own Way","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E下雨了，天灰蒙蒙的，路上已经湿了一片，不见雨点变小，路上的行人几乎都是行色匆匆，急切的想避开这场雨。不远处，走来一对父子，父亲一手拎着包，一手打着伞，走的较慢，孩子背着书包，一手紧紧拽着父亲的衣襟，一手紧紧抓着包带，步伐较快的走在父亲的身边，想是要跟上父亲的步伐，裤子和鞋子明显湿了不少，经过了一个又一个路人，留下的是两个一高一矮的背影。这样看上去一幅很平凡的画面，却吸引了许多路人的驻足，因为这幅画面很让人不解，父亲虽然撑着伞，自己却浑身湿透了，原来，那柄伞完全在挡在了孩子头上，父亲丝毫没有顾到自己。路人琢磨：是父亲是脑子有问题，还是父亲没有想到有更好的办法？为什么父亲不抱起孩子，如此一来，既可以免去雨水打湿自己的衣服，又可以让孩子的衣裤保持干爽。很快，这样的画面、这样的疑惑在网络迅速散开，很多人都在指责父亲眼中只有孩子，没有自己，这样的行为对孩子太过溺爱了，人们纷纷揣摩着父亲的行为暗示内容。有人说，父亲就想在路人面前显示自己的与众不同，吸引更多的眼球；有人说，父亲是想显示自己的伟大，为了孩子，可以全然不顾自己；也有人说，父亲在想心事，丝毫没有意识到自己已经完全曝露在雨水中了；还有人说，男主角是在给孩子做榜样，希望孩子可以为了别人，完全不顾自己……网络的跟贴越来越热闹，但就在那一瞬间，整个网络似乎停止运行了，世界完全安静下来，人人都盯着屏幕上出现的一句话“我只是想告诉孩子，现在你还小，我可以为你遮风挡雨，但我不可能为你挡一辈子，人生路途崎岖不平，不管前路如何，都得你自己勇敢的走下去，所以，你得从小开始就学会自己走自己的路。”不到100字的表述，没有一个“爱”字出现，但人人都能感受到字里行间，父亲对孩子满满的爱，这种爱不是溺爱，是一种行为艺术的爱，父亲想让孩子通过实践感受人生旅途的困难，想让孩子通过努力发现一切旅途的困难，他都可以跨过去。朱玲It’s rainy and dusty. The raindrops are not getting smaller even when the road gets wet. People on the road walk very fast, so eager to avoid the rain. A father and his son walk in a not far away place. The father holds a bag in one hand and the other hand holds an umbrella. He walks slowly. With the son’s one hand holding his father’s cloth, the other holding his school bag belt, the \u003Cem\u003Echild\u003C\u002Fem\u003E walks fast to follow his father’s step whilst his trousers and shoes get wet. They pass by many people and leave behind their tall and short back shadow. However, this common scene attracts much attention. What makes people confused is that even though the father holds an umbrella, he is all wet. The truth is that the umbrella is completely covering the child. The passers-by wonder whether there is something wrong with the father or if the father just cannot think of a better way? Why does the father not hold the child up so both can avoid the rain? Soon, this scene and this confusion spread fast over the internet. Many people criticize him, saying that he spoils his child too much and he takes care of his child without paying attention to himself. People think more about the implication of the father’s behavior. Some say that the father is showing the greatness of a father that for his child’s sake, he can pay little attention to himself. Some say the father may be thinking of other things at that time and doesn’t realize he was all wet. Some also say that the father being a good example for the child and wish the child would pay a little attention to himself for his father's sake. The internet is getting more noisy with more comments. But the whole internet seems to stop and the whole world is quiet when everybody stares at the father’s sentence “ I only want to tell my child that now you are young and I can cover the rain for you. However I cannot cover for your lifetime. Life's road is not even. Regardless of the front road, you have to walk through bravely. So you have to learn to walk your own way from when you are young.” Not even a “LOVING” word can be found in the 100 words’ expression but everyone can feel the full love of the father for his child. This love is not dotage but a behavior love. Through practice, the father wants his child to feel that even though life journey is hard and full of troubles, he can get through the all the trouble through great efforts.Zhu Lin\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":260,"date":1449020475,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"盆景的奋斗 The Struggle of a Miniascape","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E我家有一个盆景。一开始，放在家里葱葱绿绿的，十分亮眼。看到的时候都让人觉得整个人都清爽了。后来，因为致使家中蚊虫过多便搬去了阳台。阳台守阳光十足的。是一个“荒无人烟”的地方。因此它往往缺少水分。它肥硕的叶子慢慢枯萎。一点点地不复从前的光泽。叶，枝，根，一段一段的死去，即使给它淹死它也无法回复从前了，它就这样奋斗着，后来它死了！一段段的枯枝彻底烂掉，盆景中的除了它的枯枝枯叶，还有小虫子，我连让它复活的想法也没有，因为在盆中浇水时会有一股恶臭惹人讨厌。本以为是一块死地了，后来竟然在烂根处发了芽。它确实是复活了，它不复之前的高瘦形象，现在竟变得矮胖，没有以前好看了？但它还是活着，它就在那适应了新环境，这一株盆景告诉了我，绝境之处会有生机。只要不放弃，总会有成功的可能。王平We have a miniascape at our home.

Seeing certain photos or the mere mention of some past events always reminds us of those once painful memories. “We were children at the very beginning.” When I was young, my parents quarreled over minor matters all the time, and they didn’t care about my feelings. I only had a very old and shabby doll to keep me company. She had big eyes, and I liked to talk to her staring at her eyes. I didn’t care even if she didn’t respond to me. Then in another quarrel with my mom, my father smashed my doll. She couldn’t open her big eyes and couldn’t stand up and walk. I didn’t cry then, but deep inside I feared my father and hated to talk with him or stayed with him. Then after a long while…I remember how I felt when I saw my father crying for the first time. It was unbearable and I felt helpless. But I didn’t have the courage to apologize. When his shouts of anger flew past my ears, I was no longer afraid. Nor did I keep quiet. I would talk back and argue with him. I thought I won when I saw my father had nothing to say. Yes, I was tired of the discipline and restraint from my father and wanted to break through “the cage”. However, I hesitated and felt helpless and wondered if I was right or wrong when I turned back and saw my father’s eyes glistened with tears. I didn’t understand father’s love at that time but I did try. True understanding came much later.I used to quarrel with my father when I grew older. When he said “turn east”, I would turn west and went my own way. I understood father’s love when I made mistakes and tried to avoid responsibility.

I was sad. I became the target of my math teacher because of the score! After that, I knew my math teacher was severe and serious. He asked me questions in each class. I was always embarrassed when i stood and couldn’t answer the question. I was very angry. I didn’t know why these happened to me, even though I wasn’t the only one who got a low score. I even thought of skipping classes because I didn’t want to see my math teacher. I felt horrific thinking of the appearance when he was having a class, calling the roll, asking questions and so on. I always thought he hid a dragger behind a smile, which he maybe stabs to me sometimes. But I had to admit he taught me well, even though I didn’t get used to his teaching methods. There was a big generation gap between us, he was an old teacher. On a later date, my teacher asked me to attend an institute called “inclusive challenge”. The language of the institute was English, which made me dizzy. At the same time, I thought about the math exam, I felt sad. We been asked to write the stories about “inclusive leadership” after the institute, I thought the link between these. I thought carefully. I was not stupid, I was just lazy. Ones can be successful who are diligent. I thought I can have classes carefully every day, no sleep at the class, finish homework carefully, get rid of reading novels, and these things that didn’t take me much energy and time.

When I was a child, I just taste and enjoy the love from others, I took it for granted and I thought I should get the love. I was bewildered, even weak and selfish when I needed to pay back the love I got. People who do not know to give love is easy to be isolated. They will feel so lonely if they lost love someday. They will regret and reflect themselves, why they were too selfish to not give love before. I realized the value of love until that thing. It was a cold winter, the wind blew on the face was like a knife cut, we could feel biting cold even sitting in the classroom. It was raining outside, the ground flush water mist liked a nightmare, which let me be aware of a reality - I was in a cold, and I didn't have an umbrella. I was praying the rain stopped early for the whole day, but the reality was still grim. Standing under the teaching building, school bell rang. The rain was severe, and I was afraid just like the sun would not rise again tomorrow. A hand slapped my shoulder as I would cry: \"hey,* *, I have an umbrella, and we have the same way to go home, let’s go home together.\" Looked at the weather, looked at the big umbrella, I think it’s like a resort before me and I agreed. We went for a long time and passed his house, I said: \"your home is here, you can go home now.\" \"You have no umbrella, isn't it. Do you still want to have a cold?\" He said. I was embarrassed to say: \"let's go.\" Arrived at my home, I invited him to my home and have a cup of hot tea, he agreed. He entered my home, he was hiding something while drinking tea deliberately. I saw carefully and found a half of his shoulder was wet. He said:” it’s too late, and I will go home”, when I want to ask why. I couldn’t stop him, had to look at him leave in the rain with a bit of flurried and a lot of worried. The next day, he went to the hospital to receive fluid intravenously.

We can't cure cancer with our love. However, goodness and love need to be passed on.

Once i was very sensible.Every time when i, a very little child at that time, heard that my mother had more than ten bones fracture and endured great pain when i was born, i was stricken by a surge of bitterness and burst into tears .I did not know how to tell,but i truly loved my mother with my heart and soul.I was quite close with her and i liked to stay with her all the time. While my mother also liked to hold my little hand, as if she took my hand,she had the whole world. So, with my mum’s accompany,I went through countless spring, summer, autumn and winter, from babbling to toddler, and finally grew as a \"mature\" junior high school student.After i was in Grade One of Junior High School ,i gradually came into adolescence. I began to hate learning and crazily play computer games.I thought i had become an adult,so i no longer obeyed her in every way, what’s more,i quarreled with her and became estranged from her, which made her angry, very very angry. In this way, we had been in a stalemate,which lasted for two or three years, until a month before the Senior High School Entrance Examination. That day was Saturday,only a month before the senior high school entrance examination,but I was still lost in playing computer games. At this time, when my mother saw my cynical attitude towards study, she suddenly flew into a rage, the accumulation of the anger  which had been hidden for so long a time all burst out, like eruption of a volcanic. On that day,we quarreled a lot, which was the most serious time for so long. On that day, my mother beat me, which was the first time since i was born. I slammed the door and went back to my room and locked the door. However, my room and my mother's were separated only by a wall, I could clearly hear she heart wrenching crying. Perhaps her tears was the best evidence that i was wrong .That night, my mother said she would never look after me again, which made me so afraid in a way that was quite new to me. But the next day, the breakfast which she cooked for me was still on the table, with a small piece of paper added, “Dear son, i am sorry”. The high wall built in my heart instantaneously collapsed , i ran to the front of my mother and could not stop the mean tears.“ Mom, I'm sorry.” we clung together to each other tightly. I held her very tightly, so did she. There is always a dishonest person in my family, every time she swears not to take care of me, but finally breaks her words,over and over again. She is always so silly, with the injury being black and blue all cover in her heart caused by me, she loves me as the same. Perhaps only mothers have the heat and soul love for their children. Later, our relationship has been very wonderful. Many of my peers ask me why, and i always tell them the story. In fact, not because  my mother and i are more easily to get along with each other, but we become better at expressing our love to each other, rather than bury our love deeply in the heart. If you really love your parents, then please overcome the psychological barriers of adolescence (in fact, those are just excuse), take the first step bravely, and have more communication and interaction with your parents, you will gain a lot. At the same time you will find that no matter what happens to you and your parents, you will always love them, because this kind of love is the instinct.He Yuchen\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":"189","title":"Kindness on a bus. 爱的公交车","date":1449016993,"tags":["life upon life","significant story"],"teaser":"\u003Cp\u003EI can still remember that day when it happened.

Silence, lasting for five seconds as the bus started again. I knew that they were having a struggle against self-interests and morality just like me. Nevertheless, the seat must be offered to the one needs help and care. So I did it and stood beside the seat, and happened to have an eye contact with the girl who originally sat next to me. She looked at me in astonishment and then lowered her head with shame. As a result, she stood up immediately and offered her seat to a middle-aged woman. At another bus stop, there came an old man. On seeing this, a young man rose up from his seat without hesitation. Maybe it was my former behavior that had aroused them and motivated them to act like this. I felt deeply moved after seeing this scene. Love can truly be passed down and morality can indeed be transmitted.

It was a rainy day two years ago, I was a junior high school student who went home once a week. On Friday, I was carrying a bag full of clothing standing in the school hallway,eyes looking to the distance . I did not know whether it was the eager to go home or the inner homesick that dictated me to kept    stomping, and my heart was growing irritable to some extent. It was getting darker, and raining harder meanwhile my heart was growing heavier. Yellowish light cast blurry shadows on the ground. The night was around the corner, and the familiar or to say unfamiliar school even made me scared at the right moment. I began to complained about her being late, about the inappropriate rain. Rarely did me go home, the God was unwilling to cooperate though. Rainwater flow down the roof, ticking, with wind blowing quietly. The light in the corner became brighter and there was nearly no one in the campus. Soon I was the only one left in the hallway. And the guard’s figure was clearly visible in the reception office. The huge campus , giant trees in the rain, and the swirling rain in the wind, as well as the lonely one who was waiting impatiently for the family, seemed to compose the whole world. It was surprising quiet around, the only thing that I can tell was the wanton rain and free wind. When I was about in a trance, suddenly a familiar figure broke into my line of sight, from far to near. Wearing a rain coat cling to the body closely, taking a folded umbrella in hand, she ran over to me through darkness, narrowing her eyes, completely ignoring the raindrop that kept falling down from her cheek. She apologized to me before I could say a word, “Sorry, mom had been late. Lets go home together.\"    In fact , love is subtle. Even a slight action, an inadvertent word and an eye contact by chance can touch the bottom of your heart. You shall never hurt the people closest to you because of small disputes or trifles in life. To some extent, we are treating those strangers who appear to be kind to you with much sincerity, patience and love, but in reverse imposing all of our complaint, blame and self-will on the people who truly love us. However, they have always been there for you ,never change. So please don't wait till the day they are gone and love back, it is late.

We walked passed a street corner and saw people gathering there. Being curious, we walked into the crowd to see what had happened. People were whispering something. Finally I pushed through a way to the front. An old man was lying on the ground, whose hair was almost complete white, and beside him was a walking stick. No wonder that he must have trouble with his legs. “Go,go,go.it’s none of your business. He must be an liar.” Dad took my hand and urged me to leave.

But it still got me thinking that whether I would help or not if I were still there. It was indeed a hard choice considering the painful lessons that reality has taught us and the torment of conscience. Maybe I would have possibly chosen not to help.

I’ve been one of them since I was in grade two.I used to feel disgusted with the term. It somehow means you are deserted by your parents. I remember how I envied my classmates each time when their parents came and picked them up after school. I looked at myself and I felt sad. At first, my father was away throughout the year, then one day he said he had more work than he could deal with, so my mother left me alone and went away with my father. It’s kind of funny to recall how desperate I was in the early days of my mom’s departure. When my mom was home, I had nothing to worry about just like the kids of similar age. She woke me up every morning and the clothes would be ready by the bedside. Sometimes she would help me get dressed. But when my mother was away, I felt there was no support in my life anymore, and everything was a mess. I was in a bad mood, I did poorly in school, I got angry easily and was unwilling to talk to anybody. That was a dark period without sunshine, which nearly turned me into another person.

He walked slowly to my desk sat down on the chair, gently turning on the table lamp, looking over the excise notebooks which seemed to be my homework. I stared at him quietly.

The whole market was noisy and there were shouts everywhere cause it was at peak time. Suddenly a man riding a bike passed us. Unfortunately he knocked over a basket filled with vegetables and fruits, because of the narrow passage and crowd. We thought he would have said a sorry and then left. But to our surprise, he went down from his bike, helping the stall owner pick up stuff scattering on the ground and kept saying sorry. Then he took out his wallet and insisted on paying for what had been damaged by him. No matter how the owner shook his head and refused, the man wouldn’t change his mind and apologized again before leaving. The owner told us later that occasions like this are common in this market, but the man like him who apologized as well as paying is scarce, usually they would just go without even a sorry.I was in reflection on hearing this.

My grandpa is a stubborn man yet with a soft heart, which is fully covered by his firm appearance and somewhat a small rebellion streak. My grandma always wears a smile on her face, like a newly rising moon, with her white teeth shinning like moonlight. However, a tough man as my grandpa is , he has been obeying to my grandma for so many years. I guess they were kind of couple that being admired by others when they were at youth. It was a lunar new year’s eve, the white snow seemed to be designing a wedding dress for the ground, as if it was in honor of their thousands of years’ accompany. When it was around dinner time, my grandma intended to pick up my cousin, and I said I could do it instead. But she insist on going alone and persuade me to stay at home since seldom did I get time to visit her. Meanwhile my grandpa was drinking and sitting there saying nothing. But shortly after my grandma went outside, grandpa took his coat quietly and walked outside, which was seen by me occasionally. And I asked him where he was going, he replied: “I go out to smoke a cigarette, it is not proper smoking indoors.”After urging me not to tell grandma about this, he walked outdoors. I knew it was because of worrying about my grandma walking alone in a snowy weather. It was before long that grandma came back together with my cousin, finding my grandpa was missing. And she asked me where he went for, I told her he was going out for a cigarette. Grandma smiled on hearing this, and we waited at the door for my grandpa. Sure enough he appeared again in less than half a minute. My grandma helped brush the snow off his coat and head while blaming him: “Aren’t you willing to survive one or two more years to stay longer with your grandchildren? How dare you smoking again as an aged old man?” Grandpa answered seriously: “it is none of you aged old woman’s business.” After staring at each other for seconds, they both burst into laughter. And grandpa gently took my grandma’s hands as slowly brushing the snow off her head, which was completely unlike a tough man. It was indeed a symbol of tacit understanding in their minds and the most appealing love. Later on I　asked grandma if my grandpa often acted like this when she was going out. She lifted her mouth and wore a sweet smile, and answered: “I once fell over and broke my bones when walking alone at night . And that was exact the time I was pregnant with your mom. Your grandpa then knee   led down before the doctors and begged them to save her. It was the first time that your grandpa had kneeled down before others in his life. And ever since then your grandpa wouldn’t allow me to walk alone at night anymore.” Grandma always smiled sweetly when talking about this.Zhendong Shang\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":150,"date":1448978810,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"人生如足球 Life is like a soccer match","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E上初中时，每星期放假，回家后打开计算机看《天下足球》。里面通常是对足球赛事的回顾，但也不乏感人的故事。西班牙有个男孩患病，不久于人世。他最大的愿望就是代表自己最喜欢的球队比利亚雷亚尔踢一场比赛。比利亚雷亚尔俱乐部听说这个消息后，当即决定与这个男孩签下一天的合同，完成他的愿望。在比利亚雷亚尔和凯尔特人的比赛中，男孩被派上场。凯尔特人球员对男孩也只是做象征性的防守，让男孩轻松地打进一球。比利亚雷亚尔队和凯尔特人队都不是豪门球队，但两队球员的心中都有那份善良，帮助男孩完成他最后的心愿。我深受感动。竞争残酷的足球世界中不相信眼泪，但需要一些催人泪下的东西，人生亦是如此。何潇平I would go home and turn on my computer to watch Total Soccer every weekend when I was in junior middle school.

Mom must be waiting for me at the dormitory, I thought. And I ran fast to our dormitory. As expected, I could see mom standing there looking around from distance. So I sped up. Seeing me, 70 percent of happiness, 20 percent of relief and 10 percent of blame appeared on mom’s face, she said: “ Take your time, don’t run too fast like that. Do you hear me?” While she was placing delicious dishes on my small table, I asked in surprise: “Wow! The sweet and sour spare-ribs ,red-cooked pork and rib soup....did you make a fortune, mom?” She replied: “ In case that you can’t eat well in school, I have made what you like the best.” I was greatly moved and hugged my mom tightly and said : “ mom, you are so nice to me.” Then I looked around but couldn’t find my dad’s figure. Certainly he wouldn’t come, I didn’t care at all, I thought. Fragments of memories of my father gradually emerged in my heart, more and more clear. Alcohol, cigarettes and silence were nothing but him. I could remember there was once a parents-teachers meeting, my father didn’t stay silent anymore. He even took on his black suit, put on some hair spray, and looked carefully in the mirror. Then he took up my hands happily like a child and said: “Let’s go! Let’s go to the  meeting!” I struggled to get rid of his hands, shouting: “ no! It doesn’t make any sense to go with you! I want my mom to accompany me!” But when I turned back, I couldn’t no longer see my father’s face. Since then , the gap between us was becoming bigger and bigger, as if we were living in separated worlds. Back to the reality, I could still feel at a loss, which my mom had sensed. She signed: “ Actually you and your father shouldn’t have been like this, do you know? He always knew today was the day to deliver meals for you, and he went alone to the market to pick up the best ingredients in the early morning. And in fact, he did come but didn’t come in.” Being dubious, I walked to the balcony and looked down, and a middle-aged man’s figure jumped into my sight: he was leaning on a tree and smoking ,with several cigarette butts already on the ground. His gray hair was shining in the sunlight. Accidently he caught a glimpse of me, then he dropped his cigarette hastily and left, but soon he turned back to tread out the cigarette butts. I widened my mouth on witnessing the funny scene. Then I ran down stairs and walked to my father, taking up his hands and said: “let’s go!

But the God seemed to be sad today and it began to rain. The raindrop pattered on the umbrella, letting out “snapped”sound. Cars and bicycles surged out of the alley. The sound of horns and bells intermixed with conversations, rapidly but happily, as if playing a brilliant symphony in the rain. However, I thought people were in bad mood nad cursing the weather, cause a bright and leisure afternoon was ruined by the rain. When I was about crossing the road, I noticed a woman. She, who had a weather-beaten face with unobservable fear on it, wore an old gym suit and a pair of sunglasses, with one hand holding an umbrella and the other hand picking up a waking stick, tapping around gingerly on the ground to find her way. Obviously she was bind. But as she slowly walking to the middle of the road, the traffic light turned green and all cars started off at the same time. She was flurried and tapped rapidly on the ground, trying to reach the other side of road quickly, but nearly tapped on tyres several times. At the moment when I was hesitating , a boy rushed to her and lent her an arm, and I came forwards to hold an umbrella for them. Finally we reached at the other side of road. Afterwards I asked the boy why he did it. I thought he might reply me it was what he had learnt in school, but he didn’t.

I have never left my home , never lodged at school and never felt wronged. My parents have always been taking good care of me so that I can’t adapt to the new surroundings well and can hardly be accustomed to independent living. For a month since the start of senior high school , I had been like a walking dead. Each day I didn’t say a word, and I couldn’t catch time to have my meals. Moreover I was absent-minded in class and my test scores seemed to declined all the time. Every night I would take much time to call back home for my parents and most of time I would weep while saying a lot. I knew how they concerned about me. At a Saturday noon, they came to deliver lunch for me. In front of the teach building ,dad waved his hand and said goodbye to me. Going up stairs, I couldn’t help looking back, only to find my dad away from me, feeling depressed. Back to classroom, I stared into blank again. That day after all the classes were over, I ran towards my dormitory. Suddenly I heard a familiar voice calling my name, it was dad! Quickly I ran to him and then we went to the dining hall for supper. I ordered two bowls of noodles and enjoyed it together with my dad. Being curious, I asked dad why he came back again in afternoon. He replied : “ I saw you look back at me at noon. Kind of distressed I thought you are. So I came back again to check it out in case you don’t enjoy your supper.” A feeling that could hardly be described surged into my heart. I couldn’t figure it out how my dad had made it . I just wanted to see him off at that time and never imagined being seen by him. In fact, it was a really long distance between my home and the school. And it would take dad more than 40 minutes to ride, but all of this had became a piece of cake in the name of love. My dad cared me more than I had thought.Feiyang Xu\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":130,"date":1448977717,"tags":["life upon life"],"title":"爱之链 The chain of love","teaser":"\u003Cp\u003E生命中，爱真的很多，而更可贵的是将之传递下去。这是一个真实的故事。在一个寒冷的雪夜里，一位妇人的汽车抛锚了，妇人束手无策，因为是深夜，路上的车很少。即使是妇人向他们招手，他们似乎总是看不见，呼啸而过。妇人心急如焚，渴望着一位好心人的帮助。终于，一辆破旧的桑塔纳停了下来，车上的人按了几声喇叭似乎在询问发生了什么事，妇人指指汽车，两手平摊，做出很无助的姿势。接着那辆桑塔纳熄了火，走下一位男士，大概三十多岁，可是岁月早已完全地侵蚀了他，不符合他的年龄！一切足以看出他背负着家庭沉重的负担。他毫不犹豫地钻到妇人车子的下面工作了起来。不一会，他已修好了车。妇人看着他被弄脏的衣服和黑黝的手，妇人掏出一条手帕给他擦手和一张支票作为酬劳感谢男士。可男士只接过手帕拒绝了那张支票。临走时男士对妇人说：“请在别人需要帮助时，向我帮助您那样帮助别人吧！”妇人感动至极，开着车发现前面有家小餐馆，便停了下来进去吃饭，他发现餐馆的女主人依然挺着大肚子却还在忙里忙外，再看看餐馆四周破落的景象，妇人明白了什么。当喝完咖啡后，她趁那位女主人没注意时，留下了那张支票离开了，并附上了一段话：请在别人需要帮助时帮助他！这时刚刚那位帮助妇人修车的男士进来了，女主人紧紧的抱住了他：“老公，看！”当看着那张纸条时，夫妻俩的泪充满了眼眶……那位男士在帮助妇人时影响了妇人，并使妇人将爱心传递下去，形成了爱之链，链条的末端最终依旧指向了男士。生活中虽然我们不会有这样的遭遇，但将爱传递下去，爱之链会以不同的形式指向你，回报你所做的一切！黄远澈Love can be everywhere in the world , but it is more commendable to pass it on. This is a true story. On a cold snowy night, a woman’s car was broken and she was quite helpless. Since it was late at night , the cars roared past as if they all had seen nothing even though the woman waved her hands hardly. She was eager for help. Finally a car stopped by, it was an old Santana. And the driver sounded the horn as though asking what was the matter. The woman pointed at her car, then threw up her hands in a helpless gesture. Soon the Santana was off and out coming a man, aged 30 or so, who was probably burdened with family responsibilities judging from the weather-beaten face. He slid under the woman’s car without hesitation and began to fix it. The car was repaired in a short time but the man’s coat and hands were stained. On seeing this , the woman handed over a handkerchief to him and intended to pay him with a check. However, the man took over the handkerchief and refused the check and left the words before leaving , “ please help others when they need help , just like what I have done to you”. The woman was greatly moved. Afterwards she stopped her car at a cafe beside the road to have something to eat. The cafe was shabby even though the heavily pregnant owner was still on the run. Something occurred to the woman, she left the check on the table after meal and left, with words on it : please help others when they need help ! Afterwards a a man who had helped the woman fix her car walked into the cafe , and the cafe owner held him tightly, said: “ look! My dear”. The couple’s eyes were filled with tears on seeing the check and the words.

The sun is warm, and the whole people even with heart become warm when it spread on the face . Suddenly a lonely figure came into my sight. He knelt on the ground, with rickets body, and his hair messy liked a pile of straw. He lowered his head and muttered something, nothing but was begging people of discourse. A bowl with peeling paint was lying in front of him, there were only sporadic coins and a few crumpled bills. I frowned, such a beggar was not uncommon, previously I will come forward to put my own pocket money into. But in recent years, more and more news reports claimed that these so-called \"begging\" are actually richer than those of us ordinary people, the so-called disability is the use of props pack out of. No matter whose compassion and kindness are used, one will feel angry and disappointed. Let alone some people keep following behind behind, with the mouth saying a non-stop in a low voice, that this health rather than with labour in exchange for payment, really make people not like it. I took my friend's hand, trying to avoid the person, so as not to destroy our good mood. But I did not expect that she broke my hand, went straight to the beggar, and gave money to him straightforwardly, and then backed with a face of meet. I stared at her, with some iron into steel tone said: \"Do not you know these are fake you?\" \"Ah? Is that so?\" She looked surprised, \"but there is really no alternative but to begging. I will feel very uncomfortable when saw them like that poor. We can not no longer doing good just because of some bad phenomenon.\" I looked the flood of compassion \"fool\" at the front of me, and stunned, my heart seemed to have something in the spread, some things have begun to quietly change.Qian Xue\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":"100","title":"The Love from a Stranger陌生人的爱","date":1448946769,"tags":["life upon life","significant story"],"teaser":"\u003Cp\u003EOnce I thought that only familiar friends will be warm to you, but I was wrong.

Park Geun-hye’s tale is worthy to share as a story of love. Park Geun-hye, whose father was the president of South Korean, was born in such a family, that had been god-given happiness to her. She lived in the Blue House, had a carefree childhood, but not for long. Her father dodged a bullet in an event, but her mother was unfortunately assassinated. It’s so-called without mother a country can go by not a day, so she served as the mother of nation at an early age for her mother. She had to learn etiquette and kinds of knowledge. Her daily life was filled with the tight schedule that made her almost out of breath, just like mountains above her. In just a few years, her father had also been assassinated in an event. For fear of being revenged by her father’s enemy before his death, she moved out of the Blue House with her brother and sister, began to live in shadow. Since then, starting with grass-roots work, she has been known, acquainted, accepted and convinced by South Korea people. In an  election campaign, Park Geun-hye is going to make a speech,  then a assassin scratched across her neck with a knife from the back. After the assassin was caught, Park Geun-hye felt acute pain and chill on the neck that she didn’t care much. It was not until the end of the speech, she let someone send her to the hospital. Post-mortem results showed that the knife almost cut into the neck artery, otherwise she had died already. She quipped:“ I am a person who has died.”It may be the reason why she said she will remain unmarried all her life. I think she has already been married. Since childhood, she has been linked tightly together with this country. She did marry the country. Park geun-hye has indeed experienced frustrations and misfortunes, but she is full of hope and love, constantly passes them to others and affects the people around. Each of us must be filled with hope and love for that we keep holding on whenever we want to give up. Then those will shoulder a part of the pressure, and make the suffering not become the final straw overwhelming us.

   那流浪汉轻轻叹了口气，听起来却又那般沉重。正在这时，耳边突然想起了广播里的女声，我知道，那一班车就要到了。提起背包，强迫着自己往前走。刚刚走出大厅，一直告诉自己不要回头，不要去理那一丝丝牵绊住我心的东西。就要过了检票口了，通过冰冷的铁杆，就可以上车了，可是。我还是回了头，在跨过安检口的第一步，我突然回了头。在那个老旧的大厅里，流浪的人好像睡去了一般一动也不动，垂着眼脸，上身微微倾斜着。上手松松摊放在膝盖上，目光盯着前面的地上，悲苦和忧伤的像个阴影，将他那件水红色衬衫也弄褪了颜色。明天的太阳好像跟这个人也不相干了。我觉得自己跑的时候，已经回到大厅，正大步向那个人跑去。踏着那么响的步子，都没有使他抬头。我轻轻地将一张二十元塞到了他手里。转身，跑向车子。夜，像一张毯子，温柔的向我覆盖上来。吴若萱\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{"id":50,"date":1448938733,"tags":["life
